# Todo App

This repo contains a simple Todo application for study purpose.
It has the following features,

- Anyone can create a todo.
- Anyone can render their existing todos.

## Things that I have Implemented

- Created the backend of the application

  1. Created a MongoDB instance and used mongoose library to store todo title and description.
  2. Used Express.js for different method (GET/POST/PUT) routing endpoints.
  3. Used Zod library for input Schema Validation.

- Created the basic frontend for the todo using React library.
  1. Create a todo and store in the backend.
  2. Render all the todo from the backend.
